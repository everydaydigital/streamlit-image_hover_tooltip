# streamlit-image_hover_tooltip
 Floating Image Tooltips on MouseOver Event [CSS]

By using python f-strings to generate unique CSS code for each image URL in a list and then using the image URL as the background-image for the container div on hover.

No Javascript necessary & it works seamlessly without any Streamlit quirks you might expect - no need to play around with the session_cache or refresh the page for each url etc.
